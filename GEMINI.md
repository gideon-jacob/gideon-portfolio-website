# Gemini Project: Gideon's Portfolio Website

This file provides context and guidelines for working on this project with Gemini.

## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Gideon, built as a modern single-page application (SPA).

- **Framework**: [React](https://react.dev/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Styling**: [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized into the following main directories:

- `src/`: Contains all the source code for the application.
  - `src/components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `src/page/`: Top-level page components that represent different sections of the site.
  - `src/sass/`: Global Sass styles, variables, and mixins.
- `public/`: Static assets that are served directly.
- `dist/`: The output directory for the production build (generated by `npm run build`).

## Development

### Available Scripts

The following scripts are defined in `package.json`:

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the Vite development server for local development. The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **`npm run build`**: Compiles the TypeScript code and builds the application for production. The output is placed in the `dist/` directory.
- **`npm run lint`**: Runs ESLint to check the codebase for any linting errors or style issues.
- **`npm run preview`**: Starts a local server to preview the production build from the `dist/` directory.

### Coding Style

- The project uses **ESLint** for code quality and consistency. The configuration can be found in `eslint.config.js`.
- **TypeScript** is used for static typing. Type definitions are located in `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.app.json`.
- **Sass** is used for styling, with a clear structure for variables, mixins, and component-specific styles.

### Build and Deployment

- The application is built using **Vite**, as configured in `vite.config.ts`.
- The `npm run build` command creates a production-ready build in the `dist/` directory.
